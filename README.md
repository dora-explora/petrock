## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository with `git`, install Rust, and run `cargo r` in the repository to begin!

Once in, press space or click Rock to pet them, use the arrow keys and enter or use your mouse to buy items, and use '.' and ',' to turn the volume up and down, respectively. You can press 'q' or Ctrl-C at anytime to quit. But be warned, this will lose you your progress! (if you really need to, adjust line 59 of main.rs to catch back up)
